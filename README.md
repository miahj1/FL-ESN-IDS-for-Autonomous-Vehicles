# FL-ESN-IDS-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
The research area for autonomous vehicle's anomaly detection using machine learning hadn't considered using an Echo State Network with Federated Learning to create a fast hybrid-machine learning algorithm for the classification of various attacks that happen with autonomous vehicles.

The project uses datasets from these two places:
1. [Car Hacking](https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/car-hacking-dataset) which consists of five files such as `DoS_dataset.csv`, `Fuzzy_dataset.csv`, `gear_dataset.csv`, `RPM_dataset.csv`, and `normal_run_data.7z`.
2. [CAN Intrusion](https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Dataset/CAN-intrusion-dataset) which consists of four files such as `Attack_free_dataset.txt`, `DoS_attack_dataset.txt`, `Fuzzy_attack_dataset.txt`, and `Impersonation_attack_dataset.txt`.
